## Django Applications Structure

PlanPilot is organized into multiple Django applications, each responsible for specific system functionality:

1. Main App: Handles core functionality and the main landing pages
2. Account App: Manages user authentication, registration, and profile management
3. Project App: Handles project creation, management, files, and notes
4. Todolist App: Manages todolists within projects
5. Task App: Handles individual task creation and management

This modular organization promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable.


## User Flow and Interactions

The typical user journey in PlanPilot follows a hierarchical pattern that mirrors the relationship between projects, todolists, and tasks.
